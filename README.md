# MQL5_Language_REFERENCE
Source code from MQL5 Language REFERENCE for the MetaTrader 5 client terminal

I'm starting to read official MQL5 language manual. I would like to rewrite the source code from it in metaeditor to try it.
I dont have any rights to this source code. The official owner is Â© 2000-2021, MetaQuotes Software Corp.
Some of this source code i would like to rewrite in differrent way.

I am interested in to learninig MQL5 in that way build my own functions and scripts. As the final task i would like
to build my own ExpertAdvisor and create complete tolls to trading on EUR/USD pair.
